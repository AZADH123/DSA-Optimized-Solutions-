This repository focuses on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), a fundamental area of computer science that involves organizing data efficiently and solving computational problems effectively. DSA is essential for building scalable, high-performance software systems and is widely used in competitive programming, technical interviews, and real-world application development.

What is DSA?
Data Structures: Tools for organizing, managing, and storing data for efficient access and modification. Examples include Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Hash Tables.

Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems efficiently. Common algorithms include Sorting (Merge Sort, Quick Sort), Searching (Binary Search), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS).

Why DSA Matters?
Optimized Solutions: Enables solving complex problems with optimal time and space complexity.
Foundation of Computing: Core concepts for building software, handling large-scale data, and system design.
Technical Interviews: Frequently tested topic in coding interviews for software engineering roles.
